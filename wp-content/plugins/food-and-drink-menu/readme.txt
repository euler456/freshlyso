Restaurant menu and ordering made simple. Create a drink and food menu, and accept orders for your restaurant, cafe or bar, via Gutenberg block or shortcode.

== Description ==

Easily and quickly create a stylish, responsive restaurant menu for your site, and also set up a restaurant menu ordering system within minutes. With the easy-to-use menu builder, and the included layout and customization options, you'll have your menu set up in no time.

<strong>Includes Gutenberg restaurant menu block!</strong> You can also use the handy restaurant menu shortcode.

= Key Features =

The plugin comes with the ability to create separate restaurant menu sections. This allows you to divide a menu into multiple parts, making it more clear for your customers. You can even include a note for a section (e.g. "All items in this section come with salad or fries."). Some examples of menu sections you can create are:

* Appetizers
* Main Course
* Dessert Menu
* Kid's Menu
* Gluten Free Menu
* Weekly Specials

You can also accept orders through your website. Visitors can add menu items to their cart, put in their contact information, and then send the order to your restaurant. Restaurant owners receive a customizable order notification that contains all of the order information by default. Everything you need to set up your own restaurant menu ordering system!

In addition to this, you can also create completely separate and customizable restaurant menus. This feature can be used for several different purposes including individual menus for different meals, but also separate menus for drinks or snacks. It even works great if your restaurant is split up into different areas (e.g. a dining hall, a cafe, a bistro, etc.). Some examples of individual restaurant menus you can create are:

* Breakfast Menu
* Brunch Menu
* Lunch Menu
* Dinner Menu
* Wine Menu
* Drink Menu
* Snack Menu
* Cafe Menu
* Specialty Menu
* The possibilities are endless!

= More Restaurant Menu Features = 

Our customizable restaurant menu and ordering plugin comes with several additional features that will help ensure you're able to set it up not only easily, but with all the options you need.

= Premium Restaurant Menu =

With the premium version of our restaurant menu plugin, you can extend the functionality of your menu to offer your customers the best possible experience. 

<strong>New restaurant menu ordering feature!</strong>

We've just added in a new feature that lets people create food orders directly from your menu. With this option enabled, an "Add to Cart" button will appear on each menu item, which will let you add as many items as you want to your cart and then place the order. This then gets created as an order in the plugin admin panel. 

You can change the status of the order and your customers can view the status right there on your menu page, via an intuitive order progress bar.

There are options to customize the restaurant menu ordering experience by setting specific hours when the ordering should be available as well as advanced features that let you add customization options to each menu item (e.g. "Add bacon", "Upgrade to onion rings", etc.). There is also an array of styling options to modify the colors of the ordering elements, including the buttons, the cart and the progress bar.

Premium features include:

* Two new modern and responsive restaurant menu layouts
* Advanced restaurant menu ordering cart functionality: menu item add-ons, accept payments and show order progress
* Custom menu fields to add any extra info you want to your restaurant menu items
* Sorting and filtering to let your customers find the exact meal or item they're looking for
* Comprehensive icons to indicate dietary and ethical requirements, including organic, gluten-free, kosher, halal and many more
* Custom menu item flags to attach any information to any menu item
* Badges for item features, specials and sales
* Special/discount pricing
* Google maps to show off local suppliers or ethical sourcing programs
* Advanced styling options

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display my menu? =

You can either make use of the included 'Menu' Gutenberg block or the [fdm-menu id="1"] shortcode (just replace the id with the actual id of the menu you want to display).

= Can I add more than one price for a menu item (e.g. for variations)? =

You definitely can. Right underneath where you add the main price, you can click the 'Add Price' button and input the new price for your variation.

= How do I change the order of items on my menu? =

When editing a Menu Item, you’ll see a panel on the right-hand side which has an Order input field. Menu Items are listed in order of this value, from lowest to highest.

If you want one Menu Item to be listed after another, make sure it’s Order value is higher.

= How can I show that a collection of dishes come with a side? =

Each Menu Section can have a description. When available, it displays below the section title.

To add a description to a section, go to the Menu Items > Menu Sections page in your WordPress admin area. Click the Edit link below the section you’d like to change.

On the Edit screen, you’ll see an area to type in a description. This is a great place to put in details such as:

* All entrees come with a side salad or fries.
* Add cheese to any burger for $1. Add bacon for $2.
* Add fries and a coke to any order during lunchtime for just $10.

= Can I have different sections with the same name? =

Yes. It’s common for a restaurant to have two locations. Each location’s menu has a Starters section, but they might not have exactly the same Starters in each location. They need different sections with the same name.

You’ll soon learn that you can’t create two Menu Sections with the same name. To get around this, you’ll need to create your Menu Sections with unique names, like “Starters (Downtown)” and “Starters (Uptown)”.

You can then override these names when you adding the Menu Section to a Menu. To do this, click the Edit icon in the Menu Layout panel for the Menu Section.

You can then enter your preferred Menu Section name.

This name only applies to this Menu, so different Menus can each have sections with the same name.

= Can I customize the look and layout of my menu? =

The plugin comes with a base style, which inherits the look of your theme, as well as a classic style.

Since version 1.5 of this plugin, you can also make use of your theme’s [page templates](http://doc.themeofthecrop.com/plugins/food-and-drink-menu/user/advanced/page-templates).

If you want to make more bespoke customizations to the design and style of your menu, you may need to know CSS code and how to modify PHP templates. You can read some [simple tutorials](http://doc.themeofthecrop.com/plugins/food-and-drink-menu/user/advanced/complex-layouts) or take a look at the [developer documentation](http://doc.themeofthecrop.com/plugins/food-and-drink-menu/developer).

= How can I indicate that we add a gratuity? =

Each Menu has an additional editor for the Menu Footer. You’ll see this when editing a menu.

The Menu Footer is a great place to add details such as:

* All parties of 6 or more will automatically be charged a gratuity of 10%.
* All dishes are cooked in a kitchen with nuts.
* All of our meat is free-range and sourced from local producers.

= I need to mark some dishes as vegetarian, spicy or similar? =

The Pro addon features a wide range of icons covering dietary needs, healthy choices and religious preferences.

= Is this compatible with WPML? =

This plugin includes a wpml-config.xml file which provides compatibility with the WPML multi-language plugin.

= I changed the size of my Menu Item photos, but the image is still the old size =

After changing the size of photos under Menus > Settings, you may need to regenerate your thumbnails. WordPress generates photo sizes when you first upload the image, so any images you’ve already uploaded will have the old image size.

We recommend you use the plugin Regenerate Thumbnails. It will provide you with a handy tool in your WordPress admin area to regenerate thumbnails for all of your images.

If you’ve regenerated thumbnails but still don’t see any changes, this may be due to confusion between two different kinds of image “sizes”. When WordPress delivers the menu to your web browser, it loads an image of a particular size. But depending on the width of your screen and the width of the menu on your screen, the actual display width will vary.

Regenerating thumbnails and changing the image size in the settings will change the size of the image file that’s loaded into your browser. But it won’t change the width of the image as it displays on your screen.

By default, the plugin sets the display size to 25% of the menu item width, and the actual size of its appearance depends on the width of the overall menu. If you want to change the display width of the image in your menu, you’ll need to use some CSS code.
